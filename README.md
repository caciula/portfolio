PhotoWebApp

My team and I were tasked with creating a photosharing website and I was in charge of everything user related, such as registration. The site itself ran on a Tomcat server and communicated with an Oracle database.


Battery Log

For my first Android app, I created a battery log tracker. Users are able to create entries in the log and view statistics based on those entries.


Crowdsourcing

For my second Android app, my team and I allowed users to create tasks that other users would be able to complete (such as take a picture of an object, or answer a question). Specifically, I was in charge with the storage of the tasks on the user's Android phone.
